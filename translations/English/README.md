## Philosophy

The main goal of the **SA-MP Query** project is to address the inconsistency and fragmentation among existing server query tools. The project establishes a standardized **Application Programming Interface (API)**, implemented consistently across various programming languages.

This approach ensures a predictable and uniform development experience, regardless of the technological stack used. By providing a reliable and well-documented abstraction over the official **query** protocol, the project aims to reduce complexity and accelerate the development of applications such as:
- Server monitoring dashboards.
- Automation systems.
- Real-time analysis tools.
- Integrations with bots and other platforms.

The focus is on accuracy, performance, and ease of maintenance, creating a solid foundation for any application that relies on retrieving server data.

## Main Features

- **Standardized API:** The structure of methods, parameters, and return values is consistent across all libraries, ensuring that interaction logic is learned only once.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Native implementations for major programming languages, enabling flexible integration into different ecosystems.
- **Protocol Compliance:** Strict implementation of the official SA-MP **query UDP** protocol to ensure maximum compatibility and data accuracy.
- **Performance-Oriented:** Each library is designed to be lightweight, with minimal performance overhead and dependencies.
- **Open Source:** The project is maintained under a permissive license to encourage collaboration, use, and modification by the community.

## Libraries

The **SA-MP Query** ecosystem comprises a set of official implementations, each designed for a specific programming language. The development and maintenance of each library strictly adhere to the project’s standards to ensure **API** consistency and compliance with the original protocol.
